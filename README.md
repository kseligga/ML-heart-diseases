# Clustering heart disease patient data
In this project, we used machine learning tools in Python to perform data clustering related to patients with cardiac diseases and their symptoms. Our objective was to effectively group the patients so that we could assign specific diseases to each cluster, corresponding to the symptoms of the patients within that cluster.

## Results
As a result of this project, we defined 5 clusters of patients with symptoms indicating certain diseases:
- Cluster 0: Perhaps tachycardia - mainly female patients with high blood pressure. Low ‘oldpeak.’
- Cluster 1: Possibly coronary disease - angina and male patients. Mainly type 4 pain (whatever that means), high ‘oldpeak,’ and predominantly ‘slope’ value 2.
- Cluster 2: High blood pressure, low ‘oldpeak,’ and only ‘slope’ value 1.
- Cluster 3: High resting blood pressure, often elevated fasting blood sugar levels, high ‘oldpeak,’ and predominantly ‘slope’ value 2.
